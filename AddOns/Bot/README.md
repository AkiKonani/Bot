## Setup

In order for the add-on to work on retail, it's required to copy the file `data.template.lua` to `data.lua`.
Because of legal reasons (copyright law), the data for `data.lua` is not shipped.
The data is currently only used and only required for the Dragonbane Keep farming.
The data can be retrieved from WowHead or entered manually.
